# Project Goal

Create a todo list for phone and desktop that is stored as a text file, and so can be edited by any text editor.
The todo list can be synced between devices using a peer-to-peer service such as Holochain.
The user can choose to remain completely anonymous

# Technical Goals

* Todos and config are stored as text files
* Files are synced p2p (using Holochain?)
* No user information is needed to use or sync devices
* Start up time is as fast as possible

# Account Creation

Upon first start the user is asked if they would like to create a new account or to link an existing one.
