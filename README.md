# Hullatodo

Hullatodo is a todo list that satifies the follows needs:

* The todos should be easily editable using a text editor
* The todos should be editable on mobile platforms, namely iOS and Android.
* The todos should be synced anonymously between devices without the need for a central server

Lets explore these needs further. 

First "The todos should be easily editable using a text editor" this is the easiest to satisfy
just choose a todo list format and make a text file. I have choosen [todo.txt|https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt] as the format.
This takes care of the basic editing needs on desktop platforms such as Linux, OSX and Windows.

Second "The todos should be editable on mobile platforms, namely iOS and Android". Unfortunately editing text on mobile platforms is a painful user experience, therefore apps are necessary for each mobile platform.

Thirdly "The todos should be synced anonymously between devices without the need for a central server".
This is the biggy, it should be possible to sync data between devices anonymously, as in, the only thing that is really needed to identify the user is an ID randomly generated by the app. The plan is to test Holochain as a means to sync he data between devices.
